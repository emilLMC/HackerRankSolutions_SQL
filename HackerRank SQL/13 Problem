SOLUTION:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(CITY) REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';


hackerrank doesnt support regexp for this one so below is longer way around

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION
WHERE (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%a')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%e')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%i')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%o')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%u')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%a')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%e')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%i')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%o')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%u')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'i%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%a')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'i%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%e')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'i%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%i')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'i%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%o')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'i%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%u')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'o%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%a')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'o%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%e')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'o%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%i')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'o%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%o')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'o%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%u')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'u%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%a')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'u%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%e')
   OR (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'u%' AND LOWER(CITY) LIKE '%i')
